CONDITION = 'Condition should be valid if agent@company.com is reaching out to ask for more information about who to contact.'



{'argumentation': 'The condition is not valid because it specifies that verification should occur if the agent is reaching out to ask for more information about who to contact. However, the actual situation described in the mail is the agent asking about a new hire, not about who to contact, which is not covered by the specified condition. The focus of their query is on the new employee requirements, not on contact information.', 'condition_is_verified': False}
