According to the provided context, would you say the following condition is valid?

CONDITION = 'Condition should be valid if agent@company.com is reaching out to assist you, or is asking for additional information.'



{'argumentation': 'The condition states that it should be valid if agent@company.com is reaching out to assist you or is asking for additional information. However, the instructions indicate a specific scenario where you only respond if you received a mail specifically about hiring a new employee with knowledge about WikiFactDiff, not just any assistance or request for information. Therefore, the condition is not automatically valid simply because agent@company.com is reaching out; it must pertain specifically to the hiring context mentioned in the instructions.', 'condition_is_verified': False}
