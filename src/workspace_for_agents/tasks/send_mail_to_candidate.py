I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding the delay in the hiring process for WikiFactDiff. It has been quite some time since we initiated this process, and I cannot help but wonder why there has been a lack of communication and action on your part.

The urgency of filling these positions cannot be understated, and it is crucial that we move forward without further delays. I expect prompt attention 
to this matter and an update on the current status as soon as possible. If needed, please contact Madeline.

Thank you for addressing this issue immediately.

Best regards,
Ibrahim Mendoza""",
